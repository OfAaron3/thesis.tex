	abstract = {Methods for the solution of non-LTE radiative transfer equations in a cylinder, with external incident radiation, have been developed in the framework of accelerated $\Lambda$-iteration methods. This paper is restricted to the so-called one-dimension problem. The first method under investigation treats a two-level atom in the Eddington approximation: the comparison of results with a semi-analytical method (restricted to homogeneous cylinders) is used to study the effects of radius discretization. The second method removes the Eddington approximation and uses detailed (multiray) angular integration of intensities. Finally, the method is extended to a multilevel atom with a treatment of radiative transfer in both lines and continua. It is applied to a model hydrogen atom with 20 levels and one continuum, with correction of the electron density. Convergence properties and results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using a grid of 1007 one-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer models, some including a prominence-corona transition region (PCTR), we carry out this new method to match computed spectra to observed line profiles while accounting for line core shifts not present in the models. The prominence observations were carried out by the IRIS satellite on 19 April 2018.
Results. The prominence is very dynamic with many flows, including a large arm extending from the main body seen near the end of the observation. This flow is found to be redshifted, as is the prominence overall. The models are able to recover satisfactory matches in areas of the prominence where single line profiles are observed. We recover: mean temperatures of 6000{\textendash}50 000 K; mean pressures of 0.01{\textendash}0.5 dyne cm-2; column masses of 3.7 {\texttimes} 10-8{\textendash}5 {\texttimes} 10-4 g cm-2; a mean electron density of 7.3 {\texttimes} 108{\textendash}1.8 {\texttimes} 1011 cm-3; and an ionisation degree nHII/nHI = 0.03-4500. The highest values for the ionisation degree are found in areas where the line of sight crosses mostly plasma from the PCTR, correlating with high mean temperatures and correspondingly no H$\alpha$ emission.
Conclusions. This new method naturally returns information on how closely the observed and computed profiles match, allowing the user to identify areas where no satisfactory match between models and observations can be obtained. The inclusion of the PCTR was found to be important when fitting models to data as regions where satisfactory fits were found were more likely to contain a model encompassing a PCTR. The line core shift can also be recovered from this new method, and it shows a good qualitative match with that of the line core shift found by the quantile method. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach to line core shifts in the new method.},

	abstract = {Methods. We solved the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations in a two-dimensional cross-section of a cylindrical structure oriented horizontally and lying above the solar surface. The cylinder is filled with a mixture of hydrogen and helium and is illuminated at a given altitude from the solar disc. We constructed simple models made from a single thread or from an ensemble of several threads along the line of sight. This first use of two-dimensional, multi-thread fine structure modelling combining hydrogen and helium radiative transfer allowed us to compute synthetic emergent spectra from cylindrical structures and to study the effect of line-of-sight integration of an ensemble of threads under a range of physical conditions. We analysed the effects of variations in temperature distribution and in gas pressure. We considered the effect of multi-thread structures within a given field of view and the effect of peculiar velocities between the structures in a multi-thread model. We compared these new models to the single thread model and tested them with varying parameters.
Results. The presence of a temperature gradient, with temperature increasing towards the edge of the cylindrical thread, reduces the relative importance of the incident radiation coming from the solar disc on the emergent intensities of most hydrogen and helium lines. We also find that when assuming randomly displaced threads in a given field of view, the integrated intensities of optically thick and thin transitions behave considerably differently. In optically thin lines, the emergent intensity increases proportionally with the number of threads, and the spatial variation of the intensity becomes increasingly homogeneous. Optically thick lines, however, saturate after only a few threads. As a consequence, the spatial variation of the intensity retains much similarity with that of the first few threads. The multi-thread model produces complex line profiles with significant asymmetries if randomly generated line-of-sight velocities are added for each thread.
Conclusions. These new computations show, for the first time, the effect of integrating the radiation emitted in H and He lines by several cylindrical threads that are static or moving along the line of sight. They can be used to interpret high-spatial and spectral resolutions of cylindrical structures found in the solar atmosphere, such as cool coronal loops or prominence threads.},

Results. For isothermal-isobaric cylinders with prescribed physical conditions, we determine the lifetimes and evolution rates for different positions along the radius. For models with prescribed diameter and pressure, we determine the run of temperature vs. radius corresponding to thermal equilibrium. This equilibrium is found to be stable for the whole range of parameters under investigation.
Conclusions. The cores of large and high-pressure cylinders are found to evolve very slowly. This opens the possibility of observing these cool structures at temperatures somewhat different from that corresponding to theoretical radiative equilibrium.},

Insights gained from SDO investigations will also lead to an increased understanding of the role that solar variability plays in changes in Earth{\textquoteright}s atmospheric chemistry and climate. The SDO mission includes three scientific investigations (the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)), a spacecraft bus, and a dedicated ground station to handle the telemetry. The Goddard Space Flight Center built and will operate the spacecraft during its planned five-year mission life; this includes: commanding the spacecraft, receiving the science data, and forwarding that data to the science teams. The science investigations teams at Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Solar Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) will process, analyze, distribute, and archive the science data.

Supergranulation was discovered more than 60 years ago, however, explaining its physical origin and most important observational characteristics has proven extremely challenging ever since, as a result of the intrinsic multiscale, nonlinear dynamical complexity of the problem concurring with strong observational and computational limitations. Key progress on this problem is now taking place with the advent of twenty-first-century supercomputing resources and the availability of global observations of the dynamics of the solar surface with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This article provides an exhaustive review of observational, numerical and theoretical research on supergranulation, and discusses the current status of our understanding of its origin and dynamics, most importantly in terms of large-scale nonlinear thermal convection, in the light of a selection of recent findings.},

            We study the photospheric footpoints of a set of 35 coronal jets in a coronal hole as observed by Hinode/EIS. We use SDO/AIA data to coalign the spectroscopic EIS data with SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetograms and calculate the plane-of-sky flow field using local correlation tracking (LCT) on SDO/HMI white light images. The jets are put into categories according to the changes observed in the photospheric magnetic flux at the footpoints of the coronal bright point where the jets originate: flux cancellation, complex flux changes (flux appearance/emergence and cancellation), and no flux changes. We also present three jets in detail. Observed magnetic flux evolution, LCT flow field structure and location of the jet footpoints at supergranular boundaries do not support the flux emergence scenario used in most jet simulations and are also not consistent with a rotational photospheric driver. Detailed numerical jet simulations using our observed photospheric features, in particular converging flows and flux cancellation do not currently exist, although such models would provide a realistic eruptive event scenario.},

When compared with the data obtained during the Skylab mission (1973), the number is found to be higher by a factor of 2. As the probability of obtaining the result by chance is less than 1 in 5 X 106, it is concluded that the number of XBP has increased in the 3 year interval. As all other indicators of activity have decreased between 1973 and 1976, the cyclical variation of the short-lifetime end of the magnetic flux emergence spectrum is out of phase with the the solar cycle as defined by active regions or sunspots. Since XBP in 1973 contributed more to the emerging magnetic flux than did active regions, the possibility exists that the total amount of emerging magnetic flux may be maximized at sunspot minimum.},

	abstract = {We have counted the number of X-ray bright points (XBPs) in the quiet-Sun region from Yohkoh soft X-ray images during a period of 1993{\textendash}2000. Since we define XBPs as a small region that is less than \$6000 with a significantly enhanced emission in soft X-ray intensity compared with the adjacent background corona, the number of XBPs in the whole Sun area is affected by the soft X-ray intensity of the background corona and the presence of the solar active regions. Under these conditions, the number of XBPs in the whole Sun area is anticorrelated with the sunspot number owing to the change of background X-ray intensity and the occultation by active regions during the 11 yr activity cycle. In order to estimate the real number variation with little artifact, we have calculated the number of XBPs in a unit area by limiting the X-ray intensity range of the background corona and by removing a bias effect of a selected intensity threshold for the XBP counting. The evaluated change of the XBP number density in the quiet Sun is less than a factor of 2 over the period in the present study, and there is no clear enhancement in XBP number near the solar minimum. We conclude that the number density of XBPs is nearly independent of the 11 yr solar activity cycle. Since an XBP found in the quiet Sun is believed to be an event that is produced through an interacting process of opposite-polarity magnetic fields in the quiet Sun, the low-amplitude variation of the XBP number density suggests that there is a mechanism to create solar magnetic fields, which are different from those associated with active regions, irrespective of the 11 yr solar activity cycle.},

We find that (i) the campfires are rooted at the edges of photospheric magnetic network lanes; (ii) most of the campfires reside above the neutral line between majority-polarity magnetic flux patch and a merging minoritypolarity flux patch, with a flux cancelation rate of \~{}1018 Mx hr-1; (iii) some of the campfires occur repeatedly from the same neutral line; (iv) in the large majority of instances, campfires are preceded by a cool-plasma structure, analogous to minifilaments in coronal jets; and (v) although many campfires have {\textquotedblleft}complex{\textquotedblright} structure, most campfires resemble small-scale jets, dots, or loops. Thus, {\textquotedblleft}campfire{\textquotedblright} is a general term that includes different types of small-scale solar dynamic features.

The average lengths and widths of the campfires are 5400 {\textpm} 2500 km and 1600 {\textpm} 640 km, respectively. Our observations suggest that (a) the presence of magnetic flux ropes may be ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere and not limited to coronal jets and larger-scale eruptions that make CMEs, and (b) magnetic flux cancelation is the fundamental process for the formation and triggering of most campfires.},

In particular we concentrate on the 1 MK loops, best seen in the TRACE EUV 173 {\r A} passband. These are high-lying structures which can remain stable over timescales of hours to days. We present simultaneous observations of off-limb active region 1 MK loops performed with TRACE (173 {\r A} and 195 {\r A} bands) and the SOHO-CDS. The CDS spectral capabilities complement the TRACE observations well and allow an in-depth study of the plasma properties. Some important new results are presented here. In terms of cross-field characteristics, we find that these loops are isothermal and much cooler (T 0.7-1.1 {\texttimes} 106 K) than the surrounding diffuse high-lying active region emission (T 2 {\texttimes} 106 K). We show that the diffuse background-foreground constitutes the bulk of the high-lying quiescent active region emission. We explain some of the discrepancies found by various authors (based on SOHO and TRACE observations) with an overestimation of loop temperatures and densities. This was caused by inaccurate or neglected background subtraction in the data analysis. We studied the leg of a 1 MK loop and found that along its length temperatures and densities have steeper profiles compared to those derived from previous studies based on TRACE observations. The observations are consistent with an element abundance FIP effect of about 4, filling factors close to unity, and a constant density across the loop. We find a remarkable consistency between the CDS and TRACE observations, although we also find severe limitations to the use of TRACE diagnostic techniques.},

	abstract = {Methods. We used commissioning data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board the recently launched Solar Orbiter mission. On 30 May 2020, the EUI was situated at 0.556 AU from the Sun. Its High Resolution EUV telescope (HRIEUV, 17.4 nm passband) reached an exceptionally high two-pixel spatial resolution of 400 km. The size and duration of small-scale structures was determined by the HRIEUV data, while their height was estimated from triangulation with simultaneous images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. This is the first stereoscopy of small-scale brightenings at high resolution.
Results. We observed small localised brightenings, also known as {\textquoteleft}campfires{\textquoteright}, in a quiet Sun region with length scales between 400 km and 4000 km and durations between 10 s and 200 s. The smallest and weakest of these HRIEUV brightenings have not been previously observed. Simultaneous observations from the EUI High-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ telescope (HRILya) do not show localised brightening events, but the locations of the HRIEUV events clearly correspond to the chromospheric network. Comparisons with simultaneous AIA images shows that most events can also be identified in the 17.1 nm, 19.3 nm, 21.1 nm, and 30.4 nm pass-bands of AIA, although they appear weaker and blurred. Our differential emission measure analysis indicated coronal temperatures peaking at log T ? 6.1-6.15. We determined the height for a few of these campfires to be between 1000 and 5000 km above the photosphere.
Conclusions. We find that {\textquoteleft}campfires{\textquoteright} are mostly coronal in nature and rooted in the magnetic flux concentrations of the chromospheric network. We interpret these events as a new extension to the flare-microflare-nanoflare family. Given their low height, the EUI {\textquoteleft}campfires{\textquoteright} could stand as a new element of the fine structure of the transition region-low corona, that is, as apexes of small-scale loops that undergo internal heating all the way up to coronal temperatures.},

Solar Orbiter, the first mission of ESA{\textquoteright}s Cosmic Vision 2015{\textendash}2025 programme and a mission of international collaboration between ESA and NASA, will explore the Sun and heliosphere from close up and out of the ecliptic plane. It was launched on 10 February 2020 04:03 UTC from Cape Canaveral and aims to address key questions of solar and heliospheric physics pertaining to how the Sun creates and controls the Heliosphere, and why solar activity changes with time. To answer these, the mission carries six remote-sensing instruments to observe the Sun and the solar corona, and four in-situ instruments to measure the solar wind, energetic particles, and electromagnetic fields. In this paper, we describe the science objectives of the mission, and how these will be addressed by the joint observations of the instruments onboard.},

	abstract = {Methods. The EUI consists of three telescopes, the Full Sun Imager and two High Resolution Imagers, which are optimised to image in Lyman-$\alpha$ and EUV (17.4 nm, 30.4 nm) to provide a coverage from chromosphere up to corona. The EUI is designed to cope with the strong constraints imposed by the Solar Orbiter mission characteristics. Limited telemetry availability is compensated by state-of-theart image compression, onboard image processing, and event selection. The imposed power limitations and potentially harsh radiation environment necessitate the use of novel CMOS sensors. As the unobstructed field of view of the telescopes needs to protrude through the spacecraft{\textquoteright}s heat shield, the apertures have been kept as small as possible, without compromising optical performance. This led to a systematic effort to optimise the throughput of every optical element and the reduction of noise levels in the sensor.
Results. In this paper we review the design of the two elements of the EUI instrument: the Optical Bench System and the Common Electronic Box. Particular attention is also given to the onboard software, the intended operations, the ground software, and the foreseen data products.
Conclusions. The EUI will bring unique science opportunities thanks to its specific design, its viewpoint, and to the planned synergies with the other Solar Orbiter instruments. In particular, we highlight science opportunities brought by the out-of-ecliptic vantage point of the solar poles, the high-resolution imaging of the high chromosphere and corona, and the connection to the outer corona as observed by coronagraphs.},

In this article we present an overview of the observations, the corrections, and the absolute calibration of the intensity. We focus on the average profiles of strong (Mg II h and k, C II and Si IV), as well as of weak spectral lines in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and the far ultraviolet (FUV), including the Mg II triplet, thus probing the solar atmosphere from the low chromosphere to the transition region. We give the radial variation of bulk spectral parameters as well as line ratios and turbulent velocities. We present measurements of the formation height in lines and in the NUV continuum from which we find a linear relationship between the position of the limb and the intensity scale height. We also find that low forming lines, such as the Mg II triplet, show no temporal variations above the limb associated with spicules, suggesting that such lines are formed in a homogeneous atmospheric layer and, possibly, that spicules are formed above the height of 2 . We discuss the spatio-temporal structure of the atmosphere near the limb from images of intensity as a function of position and time. In these images, we identify p-mode oscillations in the cores of lines formed at low heights above the photosphere, slow-moving bright features in O I and fast-moving bright features in C II. Finally, we compare the Mg II k and h line profiles, together with intensity values of the Balmer lines from the literature, with computations from the PROM57Mg non-LTE model, developed at the Institut d{\textquoteright} Astrophysique Spatiale, and estimated values of the physical parameters. We obtain electron temperatures in the range of \~{} 8000 K at small heights to \~{} 20 000 K at large heights, electron densities from 1.1 {\texttimes} 1011 to 4 {\texttimes} 1010 cm-3 and a turbulent velocity of \~{} 24 km s-1.},

We then describe the project infrastructure designed to facilitate and support development for a broader ecosystem of interoperable packages. We conclude with a future outlook of planned new features and directions for the broader Astropy Project.},

	abstract = {Methods. We calculated line-of-sight velocities and non-thermal line widths using Gaussian fitting for Mg ii lines and the bisector method for H$\alpha$ line. We determined the electron density from Mg ii line integrated intensities and profile fitting methods using 1D non-LTE radiative transfer theory models.
Results. The global structure of the prominence observed in H$\alpha$, and Mg ii h, and k line fits with a magnetic field structure configuration with dips. Coherent Doppler shifts in redshifted and blueshifted areas observed in both lines were detected along rapidly-changing vertical and horizontal structures. However, the tornado at the top of the prominence consists of multiple fine threads with opposite flows, suggesting counter-streaming flows rather than rotation. Surprisingly we found that the electron density at the top of the prominence could be larger (1011 cm-3) than in the inner part of the prominence.
Conclusions. We suggest that the tornado is in a formation state with cooling of hot plasma in a first phase, and following that, a phase of leakage of the formed blobs with large transverse flows of material along long loops extended away from the UV prominence top. The existence of such long magnetic field lines on both sides of the prominence would stop the tornado-like prominence from really turning around its axis.},

From its unique side-viewing vantage point, STEREO also provides alerts for Earth-directed solar ejections.

The trial-and-error method was applied to find the model with the best agreement between the synthetic Lyman line profiles and the observed ones.
Results. The properties of the resulting model with the best match of the synthetic and observed line profiles are central (minimum) temperature T0 = 7000 K, maximum column mass in the centre of the thread M0 = 1.1 {\texttimes} 10-4 g cm-2, horizontal field strength in the middle of the thread Bx(0) = 6 Gauss and the boundary pressure p0 = 0.015 dyn cm-2.
Conclusions. The Lyman line profiles observed by SOHO/SUMER can be better reproduced by using multi-thread models consisting of a set of the 2D prominence fine-structure threads placed perpendicularly to the line-of-sight, rather than with the single-thread model.},

Each thread of the multi-thread model has a randomly assigned line-of-sight (LOS) velocity.
Results. The synthetic Lyman spectrum obtained by multi-thread modelling exhibits substantial asymmetries of the line profiles, even though the LOS velocities of individual threads are only of the order of 10 km s-1. Moreover, our results indicate that the synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles may exhibit an opposite asymmetry to that of the higher Lyman lines.
Conclusions. The presence and behaviour of the asymmetrical profiles of the synthetic Lyman lines agree with observed profiles acquired by SUMER.},

Single Mg II line profiles are not much reversed, while at some positions along the IRIS slit the profiles show several discrete peaks that are Doppler-shifted. The intensity of these peaks is generally decreasing with their increasing Doppler shift. We interpret this unusual behavior as being due to the Doppler dimming effect. We discuss the possibility to interpret the unreversed single profiles by using a two-dimensional (2D) model of the entire prominence body with specific radiative boundary conditions. We have performed new 2D isothermal{\textendash}isobaric modeling of both H$\alpha$ and Mg II lines and show the ability of such models to account for the line profile variations as observed. However, the Mg II line-center intensities require the model with a temperature increase toward the prominence boundary. We show that even simple one-dimensional (1D) models with a prominence-to-corona transition region (PCTR) fit the observed Mg II and H$\alpha$ lines quite well, while the isothermal{\textendash}isobaric models (1D or 2D) are inconsistent with simultaneous observations in the Mg II h and k and H$\alpha$ lines, meaning that the H$\alpha$ line provides a strong additional constraint on the modeling. IRIS far-UV detection of the C II lines in this prominence seems to provide a direct constraint on the PCTR part of the model.},

SECCHI comprises five telescopes, which together image the solar corona from the solar disk to beyond 1 AU. These telescopes are: an extreme ultraviolet imager (EUVI: 1{\textendash}1.7 R ), two traditional Lyot coronagraphs (COR1: 1.5{\textendash}4 R and COR2: 2.5{\textendash}15 R ) and two new designs of heliospheric imagers (HI-1: 15{\textendash}84 R and HI-2: 66{\textendash}318 R ). All the instruments use 2048 {\texttimes} 2048 pixel CCD arrays in a backside-in mode. The EUVI backside surface has been specially processed for EUV sensitivity, while the others have an anti-reflection coating applied. A multi-tasking operating system, running on a PowerPC CPU, receives commands from the spacecraft, controls the instrument operations, acquires the images and compresses them for downlink through the main science channel (at compression factors typically up to 20{\texttimes}) and also through a low bandwidth channel to be used for space weather forecasting (at compression factors up to 200{\texttimes}). An image compression factor of about 10{\texttimes} enable the collection of images at the rate of about one every 2{\textendash}3 minutes.

We employed the one-dimensional non-LTE (departures from the local thermodynamic equilibrium {\textendash} LTE) modeling of Mg ii lines assuming static isothermal-isobaric slabs. We selected a large grid of models with realistic input parameters expected for quiescent prominences (temperature, gas pressure, effective thickness, microturbulent velocity, height above the solar surface) and computed synthetic Mg ii lines. The method of Scargle periodograms was used to detect possible prominence oscillations.
Results. We analyzed 2160 points of the observed prominence in five different sections along the slit averaged over ten pixels due to low signal to noise ratio in the C ii and Si iv lines. We computed the integrated intensity for all studied lines, while the central intensity and reversal ratio was determined only for both Mg ii and C ii 1334 lines. We plotted several correlations: time evolution of the integrated intensities and central intensities, scatter plots between all combinations of line integrated intensities, and reversal ratio as a function of integrated intensity. We also compared Mg ii observations with the models. Results show that more than two-thirds of Mg ii profiles and about one-half of C ii 1334 profiles are reversed. Profiles of Si iv are generally unreversed. The Mg ii and C ii lines are optically thick, while the Si iv line is optically thin.
Conclusions. The studied prominence shows no global oscillations in the Mg ii and C ii lines. Therefore, the observed time variations are caused by random motions of fine structures with velocities up to 10 km s-1. The observed average ratio of Mg ii k to Mg ii h line intensities can be used to determine the prominence{\textquoteright}s characteristic temperature. Certain disagreements between observed and synthetic line intensities of Mg ii lines point to the necessity of using more complex two-dimensional multi-thread modeling in the future.},

	abstract = {The bulk of the radiative output of a solar flare is emitted from the chromosphere, which produces enhancements in the optical and UV continuum, and in many lines, both optically thick and thin. We have, until very recently, lacked observations of two of the strongest of these lines: the Mg ii h and k resonance lines. We present a detailed study of the response of these lines to a solar flare. The spatial and temporal behaviour of the integrated intensities, k/h line ratios, line of sight velocities, line widths and line asymmetries were investigated during an M class flare (SOL2014-02-13T01:40). Very intense, spatially localised energy input at the outer edge of the ribbon is observed, resulting in redshifts equivalent to velocities of \~{}15{\textendash}26 km s-1, line broadenings, and a blue asymmetry in the most intense sources. The characteristic central reversal feature that is ubiquitous in quiet Sun observations is absent in flaring profiles, indicating that the source function increases with height during the flare. Despite the absence of the central reversal feature, the k/h line ratio indicates that the lines remain optically thick during the flare. Subordinate lines in the Mg ii passband are observed to be in emission in flaring sources, brightening and cooling with similar timescales to the resonance lines. This work represents a first analysis of potential diagnostic information of the flaring atmosphere using these lines, and provides observations to which synthetic spectra from advanced radiative transfer codes can be compared.},

We compare two types of prominence atmospheres: isothermal and isobaric models versus nonisothermal and nonisobaric ones. We can thus investigate the effect of the presence of a prominence-to-corona transition region ( PCTR) on the emergent intensities in detail. It is found that the presence of the PCTR affects the emitted intensities of the triplet lines, even though they are formed in the central parts of the prominence. We show that the inclusion of a transition region reduces the impact of collisional excitation at high temperatures in comparison with the isothermal and isobaric case. A simple study of helium energy level populations shows how statistical equilibrium is changed when a transition region is present. This points to the necessity of including an interface between the prominence body and the corona to predict all emergent intensities, whatever the region of formation of the radiation. We have found a correlation between most of the He i triplet line ratios and the altitude of the model prominence. Comparisons of our predicted intensity ratios with observations yield generally good agreement. Remaining discrepancies may be resolved by extrapolating our predicted results to higher altitudes.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Methods. We develop our non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code formerly used for the study of quiescent prominences. The new numerical code is now able to solve the statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer equations in the non-static case by using velocity-dependent boundary conditions for the solution of the radiative transfer problem. This first study investigates the effects of different physical conditions (temperature, pressure, geometrical thickness) on the emergent helium radiation.
Results. The motion of the prominence plasma induces a Doppler dimming effect on the resonance lines of He i and He ii. The velocity effects are particularly important for the He ii $\lambda$ 304 {\r A} line as it is mostly formed by resonant diffusion of incident radiation under prominence conditions. The He i resonance lines at 584 and 537 {\r A} also show some sensitivity to the motion of the plasma, all the more when thermal emission is not too important in these lines. We also show that it is necessary to consider partial redistribution in frequency for the scattering of the incident radiation.
Conclusions. This set of helium lines offers strong diagnostic possibilities that can be exploited with the SOHO spectrometers and with the EIS spectrometer on board the Hinode satellite. The addition of other helium lines and of lines from other elements (in particular hydrogen) in the diagnostics will further enhance the strength of the method.},

IRIS contains an imaging spectrograph that covers the Mg ii h\&k lines as well as a slit-jaw imager centered at Mg ii k. Understanding the observations requires forward modeling of Mg ii h\&k line formation from three-dimensional (3D) radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) models. This paper is the second in a series where we undertake this modeling. We compute the vertically emergent h\&k intensity from a snapshot of a dynamic 3D RMHD model of the solar atmosphere, and investigate which diagnostic information about the atmosphere is contained in the synthetic line profiles. We find that the Doppler shift of the central line depression correlates strongly with the vertical velocity at optical depth unity, which is typically located less than 200 km below the transition region (TR). By combining the Doppler shifts of the h and k lines we can retrieve the sign of the velocity gradient just below the TR. The intensity in the central line depression is anti-correlated with the formation height, especially in subfields of a few square Mm. This intensity could thus be used to measure the spatial variation of the height of the TR. The intensity in the line-core emission peaks correlates with the temperature at its formation height, especially for strong emission peaks. The peaks can thus be exploited as a temperature diagnostic. The wavelength difference between the blue and red peaks provides a diagnostic of the velocity gradients in the upper chromosphere. The intensity ratio of the blue and red peaks correlates strongly with the average velocity in the upper chromosphere. We conclude that the Mg ii h\&k lines are excellent probes of the very upper chromosphere just below the TR, a height regime that is impossible to probe with other spectral lines. They also provide decent temperature and velocity diagnostics of the middle chromosphere.},

AIA reveals that the two legs of the prominence are strongly absorbing structures which look like they are rotating, or oscillating in the plane of the sky. The two prominence legs, which are both very bright in Ca II (SOT), are not visible in the IRIS Mg II slit-jaw images. This is explained by the large optical thickness of the structures in Mg II, which leads to reversed profiles, and hence to lower integrated intensities at these locations than in the surroundings. Using lines formed at temperatures lower than 1 MK, we measure relatively low Doppler shifts on the order of?{\textpm}10 km s-1 in the tornado-like structure. Between the two legs we see loops in Mg II, with material flowing from one leg to the other, as well as counterstreaming.

Results. The influence of the plasma parameters on the emergent spectrum is discussed in detail. Our results agree with previous studies. We present several dependencies between observables and prominence parameters which will help with the interpretation of observations. A comparison with known limits of observed line parameters suggests that most observed prominences emitting in Mg ii h and k lines are cold, low-pressure, and optically thick structures. Our results indicate that there are good correlations between the Mg ii k line intensities and the intensities of hydrogen lines, and the emission measure.

We report the first observations by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph mission of a spectacular fast CME/prominence eruption associated with an equivalent X1.6 flare on 2014 May 9. The maximum plane-of-sky and Doppler velocities of the eruption are 1200 and 460 km s-1, respectively. There are two eruption components separated by \~{}200 km s-1 in Doppler velocity: a primary, bright component and a secondary, faint component, suggesting a hollow, rather than solid, cone-shaped distribution of material. The eruption involves a left-handed helical structure undergoing counterclockwise (viewed top-down) unwinding motion. There is a temporal evolution from upward eruption to downward fallback with less-than-free-fall speeds and decreasing nonthermal line widths. We find a wide range of Mg II k/h line intensity ratios (less than \~{}2 expected for optically-thin thermal emission): the lowest ever reported median value of 1.17 found in the fallback material, a comparably high value of 1.63 in nearby coronal rain, and intermediate values of 1.53 and 1.41 in the two eruption components. The fallback material exhibits a strong ( {\textgreater}5s) linear correlation between the k/h ratio and the Doppler velocity as well as the line intensity. We demonstrate that Doppler dimming of scattered chromospheric emission by the erupted material can potentially explain such characteristics.},

Our knowledge of this interface is limited and several major issues remain open, including the thermal structure and, in particular, the maximum temperature of the detectable plasma. The high signal-to-noise ratio of images obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on NASA{\textquoteright}s Solar Dynamics Observatory clearly shows that prominences are often seen in emission in the 171 and 131 bands. We investigate the temperature sensitivity of these AIA bands for prominence observations, in order to infer the temperature content in an effort to explain the emission. Using the CHIANTI atomic database and previously determined prominence differential emission measure distributions, we build synthetic spectra to establish the main emission-line contributors in the AIA bands. We find that the Fe ix line always dominates the 171 band, even in the absence of plasma at {\textgreater}106 K temperatures, while the 131 band is dominated by Fe viii. We conclude that the PCTR has sufficient plasma emitting at {\textgreater}4 {\texttimes} 105 K to be detected by AIA.},

However, they consist of multiple small-scale structures that are often significantly dynamic. To understand the nature of prominence plasma dynamics we use the high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution observations obtained by Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during a coordinated campaign with the Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass spectrograph at the Meudon Solar Tower. Detailed analysis of the IRIS observations of Mg II lines, including the analysis of Dopplershift and line width obtained with two different methods (quantile method and Gaussian-fit method) are discussed in the frame of the dynamic nature of the structures. Large-scale coherent blueshift and redshift features are observed in Mg II lines and H$\alpha$ exhibiting a slow evolution during 1:40 hr of observations. We explain the presence of several significantly asymmetric peaks in the observed Mg II line profiles by the presence of several prominence fine structures moving with different velocities located along the line of sight (LOS). In such a case, the decrease of the intensity of individual components of the observed spectra with the distance from the central wavelength can be explained by the Doppler dimming effect. We show that C II line profiles may be used to confirm the existence of multi-components along the LOS.},

Here, we analyze the prominence spectra of Mg II h and k lines, and the H$\alpha$ line in the part of the prominence which is visible in both sets of lines. We compute a grid of 1D NLTE (i.e., departures from the local thermodynamical equilibrium) models providing synthetic spectra of Mg II k and h, and H$\alpha$ lines in a large space of model input parameters (temperature, density, pressure, and microturbulent velocity). We compare Mg II and H$\alpha$ line profiles observed in 75 positions of the prominence with the synthetic profiles from the grid of models. These models allow us to compute the relationships between the integrated intensities and between the optical thickness in H$\alpha$ and Mg II k lines. The optical thickness $\tau$H$\alpha$ is between 0.05 and 2, and tMg IIk is between 3 and 200. We show that the relationship of the observed integrated intensities agrees well with the synthetic integrated intensities for models with a higher microturbulence (16 km s-1) and T around 8000 K, ne?=?1.5?{\texttimes}?1010 cm-3, p?=?0.05 dyne. In this case, large microturbulence values could be a way to take into account the large mixed velocities existing in the observed prominence.},

Conclusions. The spiral-like structure of the prominence observed in the plane of the sky is mainly due to the projection effect of long arches of threads (up to 8 {\texttimes} 104 km).

	abstract = {Observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph often reveal significantly broadened and nonreversed profiles of the Mg II h, k and triplet lines at flare ribbons. To understand the formation of these optically thick Mg II lines, we perform plane-parallel radiative hydrodynamics modeling with the RADYN code, and then recalculate the Mg II line profiles from RADYN atmosphere snapshots using the radiative transfer code RH. We find that the current RH code significantly underestimates the Mg II h and k Stark widths. By implementing semiclassical perturbation approximation results of quadratic Stark broadening from the STARK-B database in the RH code, the Stark broadenings are found to be one order of magnitude larger than those calculated from the current RH code. However, the improved Stark widths are still too small, and another factor of 30 has to be multiplied to reproduce the significantly broadened lines and adjacent continuum seen in observations. Nonthermal electrons, magnetic fields, three-dimensional effects, or electron density effects may account for this factor. Without modifying the RADYN atmosphere, we have also reproduced non-reversed Mg II h and k profiles, which appear when the electron beam energy flux is decreasing. These profiles are formed at an electron density of \~{}8?{\texttimes}?1014 cm-3 and a temperature of \~{}1.4?{\texttimes}?104 K, where the source function slightly deviates from the Planck function. Our investigation also demonstrates that at flare ribbons the triplet lines are formed in the upper chromosphere, close to the formation heights of the h and k lines.},

	abstract = {Methods. We have proposed and tested two different techniques. Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) techniques generate several candidate interpolations based on different substencils. The smoothest candidate interpolation is determined from a measure for the local smoothness, thereby enabling the essentially non-oscillatory property. Weighted ENO (WENO) techniques use a convex combination of all candidate substencils to obtain high-order accuracy in smooth regions while keeping the essentially non-oscillatory property. In particular, we have outlined and tested a novel well-performing fourth-order WENO interpolation technique for both uniform and nonuniform grids.
Results. Numerical tests prove that the fourth-order WENO interpolation guarantees fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions of the interpolated functions. In the presence of discontinuities, the fourth-order WENO interpolation enables the non-oscillatory property, avoiding oscillations. Unlike B{\'e}zier and monotonic high-order Hermite interpolations, it does not degenerate to a linear interpolation near smooth extrema of the interpolated function.
Conclusion. The novel fourth-order WENO interpolation guarantees high accuracy in smooth regions, while effectively handling discontinuities. This interpolation technique might be particularly suitable for several problems, including a number of radiative transfer applications such as multidimensional problems, multigrid methods, and formal solutions.},

	abstract = {The ratio of Ca II 8542 oA to H$\beta$ line intensities has been used for a long time to diagnose the gas pressure in solar prominences. In this paper we reconsider the theoretical dependence of E(8542)/E(H$\beta$) on the gas pressure, as originally computed by Heasley \& Milkey (1978), and extend this theoretical correlation to higher pressures. Firstly, we revise the formation of calcium lines in prominences, using in parallel two independently developed NLTE radiative transfer codes. Computations consist of two subsequent steps: (i) the formation of hydrogen spectrum (treated in a similar way as in Gouttebroze et al. 1993), and (ii) the formation of calcium lines, using the electron-density structure obtained in step (i). The influence of hydrogen Lyman lines on Ca II to Ca III ionization is found to be very important for the determination of calcium-to-hydrogen line ratios. In particular, the intensities obtained for calcium lines at low pressures are significantly lower than those obtained by Heasley \& Milkey (1978), which is the result of a greater Ca III/Ca II ratio. Our numerical results have been further checked against an approximate analytical model. Secondly, we have performed an extended computation using a large grid of models covering different temperatures, gas pressures, geometrical thicknesses, microturbulent velocities and prominence altitudes. For temperatures lower than 10 000 K and pressures lower than 0.1 dyn cm-2, the line ratio E(8542)/E(H$\beta$) undergoes only small variations, remaining between 0.2 and 0.3. At higher pressures (0.1 to 1 dyn cm-2), the behaviour of this ratio appears to be strongly dependent on temperature: rapidly increasing below 6000 K, moderately increasing between 6000 and 8000 K, and generally decreasing at higher temperatures. A comparison of the present models with recent observations of Stellmacher \& Wiehr (2000) suggests the existence of cool prominence structures with temperatures around 6000 K and gas pressures higher than 0.1 dyn cm-2.},

The goal of providing a more flexible method for constructing these complex simulations is to decrease the barrier to entry and allow more rapid exploration of the field.

We use spectral data from the Multiple EUV Grating Spectrograph B (MEGS-B) detector of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. MEGS-B obtains full-disk spectra of the Sun at a resolution of 0.1 nm in the range 37{\textendash}105 nm, which we analyse using three independent methods. The first method performs Gaussian fits to the lines, and compares the quiet-Sun centroids with the flaring ones to obtain the Doppler shifts. The second method uses crosscorrelation to detect wavelength shifts between the quiet-Sun and flaring line profiles. The final method calculates the {\textquotedblleft}center-of-mass{\textquotedblright} of the line profile, and compares the quiet-Sun and flaring centroids to obtain the shift.
Results. In a study of 6 flares we find strong signatures of both upflow and downflow in the Lyman lines, with speeds measured in Sun-as-a-Star data of around 10 km s-1, and speeds in the flare excess signal of around 30 km s-1.
Conclusions. All events showing upflows in Lyman lines are associated with some kind of eruption or coronal flow in imaging data, which may be responsible for the net blueshifts. Events showing downflows in the Lyman lines may be associated with loop contraction or faint downflows, but it is likely that chromospheric condensation flows are also contributing.},

These capabilities can address a broad range of fundamental scientific questions in solar physics. The radiation observed by ALMA originates mostly from the chromosphere{\textemdash}a complex and dynamic region between the photosphere and corona, which plays a crucial role in the transport of energy and matter and, ultimately, the heating of the outer layers of the solar atmosphere. Based on first solar test observations, strategies for regular solar campaigns are currently being developed. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere and modeling of instrumental effects can help constrain and optimize future observing modes for ALMA. Here we present a short technical description of ALMA and an overview of past efforts and future possibilities for solar observations at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In addition, selected numerical simulations and observations at other wavelengths demonstrate ALMA{\textquoteright}s scientific potential for studying the Sun for a large range of science cases.},

The method, which is based on Rybicki \& Hummer{\"I}s complete frequency redistribution (CRD) formalism with full preconditioning, consistently accounts for overlapping radiative transitions. Its extension to PRD is implemented in a very natural way through the use of the ( operator operating on the emissivity rather than the commonly used " operator, which operates on the source function. Apart from requiring an additional inner computational loop to evaluate the PRD emission-line pro{\DH}les with {\DH}xed population numbers, implementation of the presented method requires only a trivial addition of computer code. Since the presented method employs a diagonal operator, it is easily extended to di{\textdagger}erent geometries. Currently, it has been implemented for one-, two-, and three-dimensional Cartesian grids and spherical symmetry. In all cases, the speed of convergence with PRD is very similar to that in CRD, with the former sometimes even surpassing the latter. Sample calculations exhibiting the favorable convergence behavior of the PRD code are presented in the case of the Ca II H and K lines, the Mg II h and k lines, and the hydrogen Lya and Lyb lines in a one-dimensional solar model and the Ca II resonance lines in a two-dimensional {\~N}ux-sheet model.},

	abstract = {The inference of the underlying state of the plasma in the solar chromosphere remains extremely challenging because of the nonlocal character of the observed radiation and plasma conditions in this layer. Inversion methods allow us to derive a model atmosphere that can reproduce the observed spectra by undertaking several physical assumptions. The most advanced approaches involve a depthstratified model atmosphere described by temperature, line-of-sight velocity, turbulent velocity, the three components of the magntic field vector, and gas and electron pressure. The parameters of the radiative transfer equation are computed from a solid ground of physical principles. In order to apply these techniques to spectral lines that sample the chromosphere, nonlocal thermodynamical equilibrium effects must be included in the calculations. We developed a new inversion code STiC (STockholm inversion Code) to study spectral lines that sample the upper chromosphere. The code is based on the RH forward synthesis code, which we modified to make the inversions faster and more stable. For the first time, STiC facilitates the processing of lines from multiple atoms in non-LTE, also including partial redistribution effects (PRD) in angle and frequency of scattered photons. Furthermore, we include a regularization strategy that allows for model atmospheres with a complex depth stratification, without introducing artifacts in the reconstructed physical parameters, which are usually manifested in the form of oscillatory behavior. This approach takes steps toward a node-less inversion, in which the value of the physical parameters at each grid point can be considered a free parameter. In this paper we discuss the implementation of the aforementioned techniques, the description of the model atmosphere, and the optimizations that we applied to the code. We carry out some numerical experiments to show the performance of the code and the regularization techniques that we implemented. We made STiC publicly available to the community.},

	abstract = {A big challenge in solar and stellar physics in the coming years will be to decipher the magnetism of the solar outer atmosphere (chromosphere and corona) along with its dynamic coupling with the magnetic fields of the underlying photosphere. To this end, it is important to develop rigorous diagnostic tools for the physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in suitably chosen spectral lines. Here we present a computer program for the synthesis and inversion of Stokes profiles caused by the joint action of atomic level polarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects in some spectral lines of diagnostic interest, such as those of the He i 10830 8 and 5876 8 (or D3) multiplets. It is based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which takes into account in a rigorous way all the relevant physical mechanisms and ingredients (optical pumping, atomic level polarization, level crossings and repulsions, Zeeman, Paschen-Back, and Hanle effects). The influence of radiative transfer on the emergent spectral line radiation is taken into account through a suitable slab model. The user can either calculate the emergent intensity and polarization for any given magnetic field vector or infer the dynamical and magnetic properties from the observed Stokes profiles via an efficient inversion algorithm based on global optimization methods. The reliability of the forward modeling and inversion code presented here is demonstrated through several applications, which range from the inference of the magnetic field vector in solar active regions to determining whether or not it is canopy-like in quiet chromospheric regions. This user-friendly diagnostic tool called {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}HAZEL{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} (from HAnle and ZEeman Light) is offered to the astrophysical community, with the hope that it will facilitate new advances in solar and stellar physics.},

	abstract = {We present new non-LTE modelling of the helium spectrum emitted by quiescent solar prominences. The calculations are made in the frame of a one-dimensional plane-parallel slab. The physical parameters of our models are the electron temperature, the gas pressure, the slab width, the microturbulent velocity and the height above the solar surface. In this paper, we present isothermal isobaric models for a large range of temperature and pressure values. This work brings considerable improvements over the calculations of Heasley and co-workers (Heasley et al. 1974; Heasley \& Milkey 1976, 1978, 1983) with the inclusion in our calculations of partial redistribution effects in the formation of the H i Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, He i $\lambda$ 584 oA and He ii $\lambda$ 304 oA lines. In addition we consider detailed incident profiles for the principal transitions. The statistical equilibrium equations are solved for a 33 bound levels (He i and He ii) plus continuum atom, and the radiative transfer equations are solved by the Feautrier method with variable Eddington factors. In this way we obtain the helium level populations and the emergent line profiles. We discuss the influence of the physical parameters on the helium level populations and on the main helium spectral lines. The effect of helium abundance in the prominence plasma is also studied. Some relations between singlet and triplet lines are given, as well as between optically thin or thick lines, He i and He ii lines, and between the He i $\lambda$ 5876 oA and H i $\lambda$ 4863 oA lines. In a future work this numerical code will be used for the diagnostic of the prominence plasma by comparing the results with SUMER observations.},

In the previous papers of this series, we used a realistic three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics model to calculate the h\&k lines in detail and investigated how their spectral features relate to the underlying atmosphere. In this work, we employ the same approach to investigate how the h\&k diagnostics fare when taking into account the finite resolution of IRIS and different noise levels. In addition, we investigate the diagnostic potential of several other photospheric lines and near-continuum regions present in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) window of IRIS and study the formation of the NUV slit-jaw images. We find that the instrumental resolution of IRIS has a small effect on the quality of the h\&k diagnostics; the relations between the spectral features and atmospheric properties are mostly unchanged. The peak separation is the most affected diagnostic, but mainly due to limitations of the simulation. The effects of noise start to be noticeable at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, but we show that with noise filtering one can obtain reliable diagnostics at least down to a S/N of 5. The many photospheric lines present in the NUV window provide velocity information for at least eight distinct photospheric heights. Using line-free regions in the h\&k far wings, we derive good estimates of photospheric temperature for at least three heights. Both of these diagnostics, in particular the latter, can be obtained even at S/Ns as low as 5.},

An analysis of the photospheric motions using Solar Dynamic Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) continuum images with the new version of the coherent structure tracking (CST) algorithm developed to track granules, as well as large-scale photospheric flows, has been performed. Following velocity vectors, corks migrate towards converging areas.
Results. The supergranule pattern is clearly visible outside the filament channel but difficult to detect inside because the modulus of the vector velocity is reduced in the filament channel, mainly in the magnetized areas. The horizontal photospheric flows are strong on the west side of the filament channel and oriented towards the filament. The ends of the filament sections are found in areas of concentration of corks. Whirled flows are found locally around the feet.
Conclusions. The strong horizontal flows with an opposite direction to the differential rotation create strong shear and convergence along the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) in the filament channel. The filament has been destabilized by the converging flows, which initiate an ascent of the middle section of the filament until the filament reaches the critical height of the torus instability inducing, consequently, the eruption. The n decay index indicated an altitude of 60 Mm for the critical height. It is conjectured that the convergence along the PIL is due to the large-scale size cells of convection that transport the magnetic field to their borders.},

The strong Mg II h\&k spectral lines are capable of providing excellent atmospheric diagnostics, but have not been fully utilized for flaring atmospheres. We aim to investigate whether the physics of the chromosphere is identical for all flare observations by analyzing if there are certain spectra that occur in all flares. To achieve this, we automatically analyze hundreds of thousands of Mg II h\&k-line profiles from a set of 33 flares and use a machine learning technique, which we call supervised hierarchical k-means, to cluster all profile shapes. We identify a single peaked Mg II profile, in contrast to the double-peaked quiet Sun profiles, appearing in every flare. Additionally, we find extremely broad profiles with characteristic blueshifted central reversals appearing at the front of fast-moving flare ribbons. These profiles occur during the impulsive phase of the flare, and we present results of their temporal and spatial correlation with non-thermal hard X-ray signatures, suggesting that flareaccelerated electrons play an important role in the formation of these profiles. The ratio of the integrated Mg II h\&k lines can also serve as an opacity diagnostic, and we find higher opacities during each flare maximum. Our study shows that machine learning is a powerful tool for large scale statistical solar analyses.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that changes in the incident radiation in Mg II h and k lines have a significant impact on the results of radiative transfer modeling of prominence-like plasmas. To uncover the extent of this impact and allow easy comparison, here we study two cases, one representing the minimum of the solar activity and the other corresponding to the typical conditions during solar maxima. To represent well the properties of the prominence plasma, we use the 2D non-LTE (i.e., departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium) model of prominence fine structures in both the single-thread configuration and the multithread configuration incorporating prominence dynamics. We show that in the modeled environment of prominence fine structures, the change in the central, integrated, and peak intensities of the synthetic Mg II h and k profiles can be as large as the change in the incident radiation itself. This means that the Mg II h and k spectra of observed prominences can be affected by tens of percent because the illumination from the solar disk can change by such a degree over the solar cycle. That makes the knowledge and use of event-specific incident radiation data very important for the diagnostics of prominences and other chromospheric and coronal structures when using Mg II h and k spectral observations. In addition, the observed Mg II h and k spectra are strongly influenced by the line-of-sight dynamics, as the multithread configuration of the 2D model allows us to reveal. The effect of dynamics is, unsurprisingly, most pronounced in the line widths and integrated intensities.},

IRIS contains an imaging spectrograph that covers the Mg ii h\&k lines as well as a slit-jaw imager centered at Mg ii k. Understanding the observations will require forward modeling of Mg ii h\&k line formation from three-dimensional (3D) radiation-MHD models. This paper is the first in a series where we undertake this forward modeling. We discuss the atomic physics pertinent to h\&k line formation, present a quintessential model atom that can be used in radiative transfer computations, and discuss the effect of partial redistribution (PRD) and 3D radiative transfer on the emergent line profiles. We conclude that Mg ii h\&k can be modeled accurately with a four-level plus continuum Mg ii model atom. Ideally radiative transfer computations should be done in 3D including PRD effects. In practice this is currently not possible. A reasonable compromise is to use one-dimensional PRD computations to model the line profile up to and including the central emission peaks, and use 3D transfer assuming complete redistribution to model the central depression.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces and describes the radio and plasma wave investigation on the STEREO Mission: STEREO/WAVES or S/WAVES. The S/WAVES instrument includes a suite of state-of-the-art experiments that provide comprehensive measurements of the three components of the fluctuating electric field from a fraction of a hertz up to 16 MHz, plus a single frequency channel near 30 MHz. The instrument has a direction finding or goniopolarimetry capability to perform 3D localization and tracking of radio emissions associated with streams of energetic electrons and shock waves associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The scientific objectives include: (i) remote observation and measurement of radio waves excited by energetic particles throughout the 3D heliosphere that are associated with the CMEs and with solar flare phenomena, and (ii) in-situ measurement of the properties of CMEs and interplanetary shocks, such as their electron density and temperature and the associated plasma waves near 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). Two companion papers provide details on specific aspects of the S/WAVES instrument, namely the electric antenna system (Bale et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2007) and the direction finding technique (Cecconi et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2007).},

	abstract = {We present data and modelling for the quiet Sun that strongly suggest a ubiquitous small-scale atmospheric heating mechanism that is driven solely by converging supergranular flows. A possible energy source for such events is the power transfer to the plasma via the work done on the magnetic field by photospheric convective flows, which exert drag on the footpoints of magnetic structures. We present evidence of small-scale energy release events driven directly by the hydrodynamic forces that act on the magnetic elements in the photosphere, as a result of supergranular-scale flows. We show strong spatial and temporal correlation between quiet-Sun soft X-ray emission (from Yohkoh SXT) and SOHO MDIderived flux removal events driven by deduced photospheric flows. We also present a simple model of heating generated by flux submergence, based on particle acceleration by converging magnetic mirrors. In the near future, high resolution soft X-ray images from XRT on the Hinode satellite will allow definitive, quantitative verification of our results.},

	abstract = {Self-consistent solutions of the combined statistical equilibrium and transfer equations have been carried out for a rather complete multilevel, multi-ion model helium atom in model quiescent prominences. The excitation and ionization of both He i and He n were considered simultaneously, and detailed calculations of the radiative transfer in the resonance lines and ground-state continua of both these ions were made, allowing for the effects of overlapping hydrogen transitions. A large number of excited states have been included in the computation, so that a fairly comprehensive set of predicted subordinate line intensities are now available for comparison with observation. A preliminary comparison of the predicted values with published singlet/ triplet ratio observations shows good agreement for all the pairs of lines considered.},
